00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,420
Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,409
and programming explicit algorithms with good

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,480
performance is difficult or infeasible.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,239
Example,

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,979
applications include email filtering detection of

6
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,909
network intruders and computer vision.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,700
Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics which also

8
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,040
focuses on predictions making through the use of computer.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,329
It has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,159
methods theory and application domains to the field.
